# Description: This process involves leveraging a global community to generate, refine, and implement innovative ideas for a companyâ€™s product line. It starts with launching a challenge, collecting submissions, and then curating entries through multiple review stages including peer voting and expert evaluation. Selected ideas undergo prototyping, iterative feedback loops with contributors, and final validation before integration into the product roadmap. The process requires coordination across multiple teams, continuous engagement with external contributors, and adaptive resource allocation based on idea potential and community response. It ensures a dynamic flow of creativity while maintaining quality and strategic alignment with business goals.
