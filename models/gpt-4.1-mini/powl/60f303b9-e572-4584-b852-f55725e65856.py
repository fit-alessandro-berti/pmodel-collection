# Description: This process outlines the complex and atypical steps involved in establishing an urban drone delivery network for perishable goods. It includes site assessment, regulatory compliance, drone fleet configuration, dynamic route planning, real-time weather monitoring, payload optimization, multi-agent coordination, emergency response setup, and continuous data analysis to ensure safe, efficient, and scalable delivery in dense metropolitan environments while minimizing environmental impact and adhering to privacy laws.

# Breakdown the process based on description and logical dependencies:

# Phase 1: Site Survey and Permit Check (sequential)
phase1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SiteSurvey, PermitCheck])
phase1.order.add_edge(SiteSurvey, PermitCheck)

# Phase 2: Fleet configuration and Payload preparation (likely sequential)
phase2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[FleetConfig, PayloadPrep])
phase2.order.add_edge(FleetConfig, PayloadPrep)

# Phase 3: Route Design and Weather Track run concurrently (dynamic route planning and real-time weather monitoring)
phase3 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[RouteDesign, WeatherTrack])
# no order edge → concurrent

# Phase 4: Signal Setup and Flight Test (sequential)
phase4 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SignalSetup, FlightTest])
phase4.order.add_edge(SignalSetup, FlightTest)

# Phase 5: Load Balance and Data Sync (concurrent multi-agent coordination and continuous data analysis)
phase5 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[LoadBalance, DataSync])
# no order edge → concurrent

# Phase 6: Risk Assess and Emergency Drill and Privacy Audit (sequential for compliance and emergency setup)
phase6 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[RiskAssess, EmergencyDrill, PrivacyAudit])
phase6.order.add_edge(RiskAssess, EmergencyDrill)
phase6.order.add_edge(EmergencyDrill, PrivacyAudit)

# Phase 7: Fleet Deploy and Delivery Track (sequential: deploy fleet then track delivery)
phase7 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[FleetDeploy, DeliveryTrack])
phase7.order.add_edge(FleetDeploy, DeliveryTrack)

# Feedback Loop is a continuous loop after delivery tracking for improvements

# Define the loop: after FeedbackLoop, go to RiskAssess for continuous improvement, modeled as:
# loop = LOOP(body=phase_after_feedback, redo=FeedbackLoop)
# But the description suggests continuous data analysis to ensure ongoing compliance and efficiency

# Create the loop as:
# LOOP(
#   A = RiskAssess to PrivacyAudit (phase6),
#   B = FeedbackLoop
# )
loop_body = phase6
loop_redo = FeedbackLoop
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[loop_body, loop_redo])

# Now compose the whole process partial order (main flow):
# Order:
# phase1 -> phase2 -> phase3 -> phase4 -> phase5 -> phase7 -> loop
