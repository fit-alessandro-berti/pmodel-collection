# Description: This process governs the acquisition, evaluation, and rotation of artwork leased to corporate offices for aesthetic enhancement and brand alignment. It involves curating pieces based on corporate culture, negotiating lease terms with artists or galleries, scheduling installation and maintenance, and periodically rotating collections to refresh environments. Feedback from employees is collected to assess impact on workplace ambiance and productivity. Additionally, the process includes managing insurance, provenance verification, and coordinating art events to engage stakeholders. The goal is to maintain a dynamic, inspiring visual environment while optimizing budget and compliance with corporate policies.
