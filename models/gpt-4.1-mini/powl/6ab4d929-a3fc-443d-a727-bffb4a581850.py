# Description: This process outlines the detailed steps involved in producing and distributing artisanal cheese from small-scale farms to gourmet retail outlets. It includes raw milk collection from diverse breeds, precise temperature-controlled fermentation, multiple rounds of quality assessment, packaging with eco-friendly materials, specialized cold-chain logistics, and targeted marketing to niche consumers. The process also incorporates feedback loops with cheesemakers and retailers to continually refine taste profiles and shelf life, ensuring product consistency and brand reputation in a highly competitive specialty food market.

# Connect nodes:
# Fermentation --> Rind Treatment & Aging Monitor (aging_section)
# Fermentation --> quality_loop (quality assessment loop)

# Packaging starts after quality checks complete â€” after Quality_Check in quality_loop

# Order Processing happens after Retail Delivery
# feedback_loop on Order Processing <-> Customer Feedback

    nodes=[
        prod_steps,
        aging_section,
        quality_loop,
        packaging_and_logistics,

        feedback_loop

# Define ordering edges:

# From prod_steps' last activity Fermentation to aging_section and quality_loop (start)
root.order.add_edge(prod_steps, aging_section)
root.order.add_edge(prod_steps, quality_loop)

# Quality loop involves Quality Testing and Quality Check internally looping.
# Packaging starts after quality_loop finishes (Quality_Check)
root.order.add_edge(quality_loop, packaging_and_logistics)

# Packaging ends with Retail Delivery, then Order Processing starts
root.order.add_edge(packaging_and_logistics, Order_Processing)

# Feedback loop around Order Processing and Customer Feedback
root.order.add_edge(Order_Processing, feedback_loop)

# The classes require edges between nodes (which must be nodes from root.nodes)
# But we added some arcs with prod_steps, aging_section, etc., which are StrictPartialOrder and OperatorPOWL objects.

# For strict typing, prod_steps is StrictPartialOrder as node, aging_section is StrictPartialOrder as node, quality_loop is OperatorPOWL node, etc.

# No direct edges needed inside these contained partial orders except their internal edges.

# This models the described process with partial concurrency and loops
