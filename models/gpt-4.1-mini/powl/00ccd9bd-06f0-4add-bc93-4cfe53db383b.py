# Description: This process involves integrating quantum computing algorithms into traditional supply chain management to optimize inventory, forecasting, and logistics dynamically in real-time. The workflow incorporates quantum data encryption, probabilistic demand modeling, and adaptive routing that reacts to environmental changes and market volatility instantly. It also includes cross-border regulatory compliance checks using AI-driven legal scanners and blockchain verification, ensuring secure and transparent transactions across multiple stakeholders. The process ends with continuous feedback loops from IoT sensors and predictive maintenance schedules, enabling proactive risk mitigation and sustainable resource allocation.

# Quantum data encryption and probabilistic demand modeling happen after data ingestion
# Inventory audit follows demand model

# Adaptive routing reacts after inventory audit
# Cross-border regulatory compliance includes ComplianceScan and BlockchainVerify concurrently

# Risk assessment, stakeholder sync come next

# Continuous feedback loop involves IoT Monitor, Forecast Adjust, Order Confirm, Shipment Track,
# Maintenance Plan, Feedback Loop, and Resource Allocate with loops

# Loop definition:
# We can model the continuous feedback loops as a loop with body as maintenance and feedback activities

# Define feedback workflow PO1:
feedback_activities = [IoTMonitor, ForecastAdjust, OrderConfirm, ShipmentTrack, MaintenancePlan, FeedbackLoop, ResourceAllocate]

feedback_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=feedback_activities)
# Let's order them loosely to enable some concurrency but some dependencies:
# For example, forecast adjust and order confirm after IoT monitor
feedback_po.order.add_edge(IoTMonitor, ForecastAdjust)
feedback_po.order.add_edge(IoTMonitor, OrderConfirm)
feedback_po.order.add_edge(OrderConfirm, ShipmentTrack)
feedback_po.order.add_edge(MaintenancePlan, FeedbackLoop)
feedback_po.order.add_edge(FeedbackLoop, ResourceAllocate)
# MaintenancePlan can be concurrent with ShipmentTrack but both feed into FeedbackLoop? 
# To keep partial order safe, just add edges that order them in causality:
feedback_po.order.add_edge(ShipmentTrack, FeedbackLoop)
# This allows partial concurrency with defined dependencies

# Define the LOOP: loop body is feedback_po followed by skip to exit
loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[feedback_po, skip])

# Compliance checks in parallel: ComplianceScan and BlockchainVerify -> parallel (partial order, no order edges)
compliance_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ComplianceScan, BlockchainVerify])

# After routing optimization, compliance checks start
# Define routing optimization partial order as just RouteOptimize

# After InventoryAudit -> RouteOptimize

# Demand model after Quantum Encrypt
# Inventory Audit after Demand Model

# Quantum Encrypt after Data Ingestion

# Then sequence:
# DataIngestion -> QuantumEncrypt -> DemandModel -> InventoryAudit -> RouteOptimize -> compliance_po

# Then after compliance, RiskAssess, StakeholderSync proceed sequentially

# Then the feedback loop

# Compose main sequence as a StrictPartialOrder with nodes containing all relevant parts

# We will include all atomic activities and all complex operators
