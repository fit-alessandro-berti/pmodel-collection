# Description: This process involves integrating quantum computing capabilities into traditional supply chain management to optimize logistics, inventory, and demand forecasting in real-time. It starts with data ingestion from diverse sources, followed by quantum algorithm deployment for route optimization and risk assessment. Parallel simulation of multiple supply scenarios allows for dynamic adjustment of procurement and distribution strategies. The process also includes anomaly detection through quantum-enhanced machine learning, supplier collaboration via secure quantum communication, and continuous feedback loops for performance refinement. Finally, insights are translated into automated decisions for cost reduction and resilience enhancement, enabling a futuristic, adaptive supply network.

# Step 1: Data Ingestion
# Step 2: Quantum Setup (quantum algorithm deployment)
# Then two main parallel branches:
#   Branch A: Route Optimize & Risk Assess & Demand Forecast in partial order (some can be concurrent)
#   Branch B: Scenario Simulate (parallel to Branch A)
# After simulation, Procurement Plan and Inventory Adjust depend on results dynamically (put after Scenario Simulate)
# Anomaly Detect and Supplier Sync happen next (with Supplier Sync involving Quantum Communicate)
# We assume Supplier Sync -> Quantum Communicate
# Then continuous feedback loop: Performance Track -> Feedback Loop, that loops back (loop)
# Finally Decision Automate -> Cost Analyze -> Network Adapt

# Build partial orders for subtasks where concurrency is implied

# Branch A partial order: Route Optimize, Risk Assess, Demand Forecast
# Assume Route Optimize and Demand Forecast can be concurrent, but Risk Assess after Route Optimize
branchA = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[RouteOptimize, DemandForecast, RiskAssess])
branchA.order.add_edge(RouteOptimize, RiskAssess)  # Risk Assess after Route Optimize
# Demand Forecast is concurrent with both

# Branch B is a simple single activity: Scenario Simulate

# Branch A and Branch B run in parallel after Quantum Setup
# Then Procurement Plan and Inventory Adjust after Scenario Simulate
procure_inventory = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ProcurementPlan, InventoryAdjust])
# Assume Procurement Plan before Inventory Adjust
