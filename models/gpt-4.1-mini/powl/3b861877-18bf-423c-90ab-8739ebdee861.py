# Description: This process involves locating, authenticating, and repatriating corporate artifacts lost or stolen during historical mergers and acquisitions. It begins with artifact identification using archival research, followed by stakeholder interviews to verify provenance. Legal consultations ensure compliance with international ownership laws. Next, covert negotiations with current holders are conducted to facilitate return agreements. Logistics planning addresses secure transport and customs clearance. Finally, artifacts are restored, cataloged, and integrated into corporate heritage exhibits to preserve brand legacy and employee engagement.

# Step 1: Artifact ID + Archival Scan (concurrent or sequential?)
# Description says "begins with artifact identification using archival research"
# I interpret this as Artifact ID then Archival Scan
# Then Stakeholder interviews to verify provenance
# Which includes Stakeholder Meet and Provenance Check (sequential)
# Legal Consultations: Legal Review, Ownership Audit (concurrent)
# Covert negotiations: Negotiation Prep, Stakeholder Contact, Agreement Draft (sequential)
# Logistics planning: Transport Plan, Customs Clear (sequential)
# Final: restore, catalog, exhibit, legacy report (concurrent or sequential?)
# Description says restored, cataloged, and integrated - sounds sequential
