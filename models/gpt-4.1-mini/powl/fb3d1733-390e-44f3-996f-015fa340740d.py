# Description: This process involves the meticulous restoration of vintage mechanical watches, combining delicate craftsmanship with historical research. It begins with initial assessment to evaluate the watch's condition and authenticity, followed by disassembly and ultrasonic cleaning of all parts. Components are then inspected for wear or damage, with custom fabrication of missing or broken gears when necessary. Dial restoration includes color correction and repainting faded markers. The movement is reassembled, lubricated, and calibrated for accurate timekeeping. Finally, the case is polished and re-cased, and the watch undergoes rigorous quality testing before packaging. Throughout, detailed documentation preserves the watchâ€™s provenance and restoration steps to maintain its collectible value.
