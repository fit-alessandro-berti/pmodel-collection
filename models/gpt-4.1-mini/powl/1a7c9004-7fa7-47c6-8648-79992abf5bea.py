# Description: This process details the intricate steps involved in sourcing, producing, and distributing artisan cheese with a focus on maintaining quality and authenticity. It begins with selecting rare milk sources, followed by specialized fermentation and aging stages. Quality control includes sensory evaluation and microbial testing to ensure safety and flavor consistency. Packaging is done in eco-friendly materials, with customized labeling reflecting the cheeseâ€™s origin. Distribution channels are unique, targeting niche gourmet retailers and direct-to-consumer subscriptions. Throughout the process, traceability and sustainability reporting are integral to meet regulatory and consumer demands, making this supply chain highly specialized and complex.

# Quality review is a PO no order between SR/MCk; we need to embed that in a node for order with QT:
# But our strict partial order nodes are only Transitions and Operators,
# So treat quality_review as an OperatorPOWL of concurrency is not given => better do a PO with SR and MCk unordered, then QT after
