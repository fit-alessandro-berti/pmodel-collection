# Description: This process outlines the complex steps involved in establishing an urban drone delivery system specifically tailored for high-density metropolitan areas with strict regulatory environments. It encompasses site analysis, drone fleet customization, air traffic coordination, and real-time data integration from multiple sources. The process also includes stakeholder engagement from local authorities, continuous compliance monitoring, dynamic route optimization, and emergency response planning. The goal is to create a safe, efficient, and scalable delivery network that minimizes environmental impact while addressing logistical challenges unique to urban landscapes.

# Model key process parts:

# 1. Regulatory and permit related steps (Permit Request loops over Regulation Review)
Reg_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Permit_Request, Regulation_Review])

# 2. Stakeholder engagement and air traffic coordination (Stakeholder Meet then concurrent Traffic Sync and Route Mapping)
Stakeholder_seq = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Stakeholder_Meet, Route_Mapping, Traffic_Sync])
Stakeholder_seq.order.add_edge(Stakeholder_Meet, Route_Mapping)
Stakeholder_seq.order.add_edge(Stakeholder_Meet, Traffic_Sync)
# Route_Mapping and Traffic_Sync are concurrent after Stakeholder_Meet

# 3. Drone preparation steps (Drone Assembly, Software Setup, Test Flight) in sequence
Drone_setup = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Drone_Assembly, Software_Setup, Test_Flight])
Drone_setup.order.add_edge(Drone_Assembly, Software_Setup)
Drone_setup.order.add_edge(Software_Setup, Test_Flight)

# 4. Data Integration feeds Compliance Audit and Emergency Planning (a choice happens if needed)

# Compliance Audit and Emergency Plan might be chosen exclusively after Data Integration

# 6. Feedback loop: Feedback Loop and Performance Tune repeat as a loop
Feedback_loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Feedback_Loop, Performance_Tune])

# 7. Scale Strategy done after Launch Prep
# Final partial order combining major blocks:
root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Site_Survey, Fleet_Design, Reg_loop, Preparation_PO, Post_Data, Feedback_loop, Scale_Strategy])

# Order:
# Site Survey -> Fleet Design -> Permit Request loop
root.order.add_edge(Site_Survey, Fleet_Design)
root.order.add_edge(Fleet_Design, Reg_loop)

# Reg_loop -> Preparation_PO
root.order.add_edge(Reg_loop, Preparation_PO)

# Preparation_PO -> Post_Data
root.order.add_edge(Preparation_PO, Post_Data)

# Post_Data -> Feedback loop
root.order.add_edge(Post_Data, Feedback_loop)

# Feedback loop -> Scale Strategy
root.order.add_edge(Feedback_loop, Scale_Strategy)
