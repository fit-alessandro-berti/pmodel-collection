# Description: This process outlines the comprehensive steps required to establish a fully operational urban vertical farm within a repurposed warehouse. It involves initial site analysis, structural retrofitting, environmental control system installation, hydroponic and aeroponic system integration, nutrient solution calibration, automated monitoring deployment, staff training, and ongoing yield optimization. The process ensures sustainable resource usage, minimal environmental impact, and maximized crop output through precision agriculture technologies. It also includes regulatory compliance checks and community engagement initiatives to promote local food production and urban greening efforts.

# According to description, the activities can be partially ordered roughly as:

# Phase 1: Initial analysis and design
phase1 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SiteSurvey, StructuralAudit, DesignLayout])
phase1.order.add_edge(SiteSurvey, StructuralAudit)
phase1.order.add_edge(StructuralAudit, DesignLayout)

# Phase 2: Structural retrofit and system install
phase2 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[Retrofitting, SystemInstall])
phase2.order.add_edge(Retrofitting, SystemInstall)

# Phase 3: Environmental setup and nutrient prep concurrent
setup = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ClimateSetup, NutrientPrep])
# concurrent: no edges

# Phase 4: Plant seeding followed by sensor deployment and automation tuning sequentially
phase4 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[PlantSeeding, SensorDeploy, AutomationTune])
phase4.order.add_edge(PlantSeeding, SensorDeploy)
phase4.order.add_edge(SensorDeploy, AutomationTune)

# Phase 5: Staff training
# can happen after automation tuning
phase5 = StaffTraining

# Phase 6: Monitoring, data analysis, and yield optimization (Yield Monitor, Data Analysis)
phase6 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[YieldMonitor, DataAnalysis])
phase6.order.add_edge(YieldMonitor, DataAnalysis)

# Phase 7: Compliance check and community meeting concurrent
phase7 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ComplianceCheck, CommunityMeet])
# concurrent no edges

# Phase 8: Waste management and energy audit concurrent
phase8 = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[WasteManage, EnergyAudit])
# concurrent no edges

# Now we create a top-level partial order to represent approximate control flow:

root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[phase1, phase2, setup, phase4, phase5, phase6, phase7, phase8])

# Establish partial order edges between phases:
root.order.add_edge(phase1, phase2)        # Design layout before Retrofitting
root.order.add_edge(phase2, setup)         # System install before environment setup/nutrient prep
root.order.add_edge(setup, phase4)         # After setup do plant seeding...
root.order.add_edge(phase4, phase5)        # Staff training after automation tune
root.order.add_edge(phase5, phase6)        # Monitoring after staff training
root.order.add_edge(phase6, phase7)        # Compliance and community meeting after data analysis
root.order.add_edge(phase7, phase8)        # Waste and energy management after community/ compliance

# This models the overall process respecting concurrency and sequencing described.
