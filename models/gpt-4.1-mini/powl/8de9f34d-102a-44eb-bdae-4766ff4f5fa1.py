# Description: This process details the end-to-end supply chain for artisan cheese production and distribution, involving unique steps like raw milk sourcing from specific breeds, microbial culture selection, seasonal aging conditions, and quality validation through sensory panels. It integrates traditional craftsmanship with modern logistics, ensuring traceability from farm to boutique stores. Activities include milk testing, starter prep, curd cutting, whey drainage, pressing, salting, controlled aging, flavor profiling, packaging design, cold chain management, boutique allocation, seasonal forecasting, customer feedback, and artisanal marketing strategies to optimize both quality and market reach while maintaining the cheeseâ€™s unique regional character.

# Construct partial order
# Milk Sourcing --> Microbe Selection --> Starter Prep --> Milk Pasteurize
# After pasteurize: Curd Cutting --> Whey Drainage --> Cheese Pressing --> Salt Application
# Then Controlled Aging --> Quality Testing
# After Quality Testing, parallel packaging & marketing logistics:
# Packaging branch: Package Design --> Cold Storage --> Boutique Allocation
# Marketing branch: Market Forecast
# Flavor Profiling happens concurrently with Quality Testing (to profile flavors while testing)
# Controlled Aging must finish before Flavor Profiling and Quality Testing
# Boutique Allocation depends on Cold Storage
# Market Forecast is concurrent with Packaging pipeline but happens after Quality Testing
