# Description: This process involves the identification, negotiation, and acquisition of valuable corporate artifacts from defunct or merged companies. It begins with research to locate items of interest such as patents, prototypes, or historical documents. Following discovery, legal clearance and ownership verification are conducted to ensure rights to acquire and use the artifacts. Negotiations with sellers or estates proceed alongside appraisal and valuation to determine fair market price. Once acquired, artifacts undergo authentication and restoration if needed. The process concludes with cataloging, digital archiving, and integration into the companyâ€™s heritage collection to preserve corporate history and leverage intangible assets for branding and innovation inspiration.
