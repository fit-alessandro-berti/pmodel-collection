# Description: This process involves integrating quantum computing simulations to optimize and verify supply chain decisions in near real-time. It begins with data ingestion from multiple global suppliers, followed by quantum state modeling to predict disruptions. The process includes dynamic risk assessment, adaptive route recalculations, and automated contract renegotiations based on probabilistic outcomes. Additionally, it incorporates secure quantum encryption for data exchanges and continuous feedback loops to machine learning models for improving accuracy. The process concludes with stakeholder reporting and system recalibration, ensuring resilient and efficient supply operations despite unprecedented uncertainties.

# Step 1: Concurrent data ingestion from multiple global suppliers
# model as partial order of SupplierSync and DemandForecast preceding DataIngest
# To reflect "data ingestion from multiple global suppliers", interpret SupplierSync and DemandForecast as concurrent activities before DataIngest.
data_ingestion = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SupplierSync, DemandForecast, DataIngest])
data_ingestion.order.add_edge(SupplierSync, DataIngest)

# Step 2: Quantum state modeling and simulation afterwards, run in partial order

# We'll model a loop: execute (FeedbackLoop) then exit or re-execute (QuantumModel + SimulateStates + RiskAssess + RouteUpdate + ContractReview + EncryptData + FeedbackLoop)
# To do so, first create the body of the loop after the feedback loop:

# Construct nodes for body of loop after feedback, excluding FeedbackLoop because it is loop operand A
