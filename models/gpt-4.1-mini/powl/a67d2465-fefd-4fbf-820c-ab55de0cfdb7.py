# Description: This process describes an atypical yet realistic approach to driving innovation by integrating insights from multiple unrelated industries. It begins with trend spotting and opportunity mapping across sectors, followed by ideation sessions involving cross-disciplinary teams. Concepts undergo rapid prototyping using hybrid technologies, then move to experimental deployment in controlled environments. Feedback loops incorporate data analytics, user behavior studies, and scenario simulations to refine solutions. Strategic partnerships are formed with external experts and startups to accelerate development. Finally, scalable rollouts are planned alongside continuous monitoring to adapt innovations dynamically in response to evolving market and technological landscapes. This cyclical process fosters disruptive breakthroughs by challenging conventional industry boundaries and leveraging diverse knowledge bases.

# Define the loop:  
# Loop body is: three sequences above with feedback_partnership_final_PO as "A"
# and the tau (skip) transition as the exit.

# For the POWL loop, children=[A,B]
# B is repeated body executed before A again
# From definition, loop (* (A,B)) means execute A, then choose to exit or execute B then A again

# Here, A will be the full sequence: trend_op -> ideation -> proto_deploy -> feedback_partnership_final_PO
# B will be Cycle_Repeat modeled as silent transition tau to represent the repetition choice

# But Cycle_Repeat is an activity, the description actually says the process is cyclical:
# So more properly, the last step Monitor Adapt adapts to the market, making a full cycle.
# The loop repetition must be modeled as LOOP(A,B) with A = the sequence of the full process, and B = a silent transition representing repeat

# Actually, LOOP(A,B) = execute A, then either exit, or execute B then A again, repeated until exit.
# Here B represents the body to be executed before repeating A again.

# Cycle Repeat is an activity from the list, so let's place it as B
# So the loop body:
# - A: full process
# - B: Cycle Repeat activity, representing iteration of the full cycle

# So the model: LOOP(A=full_process, B=Cycle_Repeat)
