# Description: This process involves the systematic examination and verification of antique artifacts to determine authenticity and provenance. It integrates multidisciplinary assessments including material analysis, historical context evaluation, stylistic comparison, and provenance research. Experts collaborate to detect forgeries, restorations, or alterations while ensuring compliance with legal and ethical standards. The process culminates in certification, documentation, and recommendations for conservation or sale, tailored to the artifactâ€™s unique characteristics and market demand.
