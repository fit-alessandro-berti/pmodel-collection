# Description: This process involves the complex validation and authentication of rare cultural artifacts sourced globally. It encompasses provenance research, multi-layered material analysis, expert consensus, and legal compliance verification. Each artifact undergoes detailed historical cross-referencing, advanced chemical testing, and digital imaging before final certification. The process also includes stakeholder coordination spanning archaeologists, legal advisors, and auction houses, ensuring authenticity, ethical acquisition, and traceability. Post-authentication, artifacts are cataloged with secure blockchain entries to prevent forgery, and continuous monitoring for ownership disputes is maintained, integrating international regulatory updates and client feedback loops.

# Build provenance+material validation+authentication sub partial order:
# Provenance Research includes Provenance Check and Historical Match (likely sequential)
# Material Analysis includes Material Scan and Chemical Test (sequential)
# Authentication includes Expert Review, Consensus Vote, Legal Verify (partial order with some concurrency possible)
# Imaging Capture concurrent with Chemical Test or after? It's part of detailed testing, so we put it after MaterialScan, concurrent with ChemicalTest.

# HistoricalMatch is part of provenance research, so order: ProvenanceCheck --> HistoricalMatch
provenance_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[ProvenanceCheck, HistoricalMatch])
provenance_po.order.add_edge(ProvenanceCheck, HistoricalMatch)

# MaterialScan --> ChemicalTest
material_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[MaterialScan, ChemicalTest])
material_po.order.add_edge(MaterialScan, ChemicalTest)

# ImagingCapture can happen after MaterialScan and probably concurrently with ChemicalTest
imaging_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[MaterialScan, ImagingCapture])
imaging_po.order.add_edge(MaterialScan, ImagingCapture)

# Combine material_po and imaging_po into combined material analysis:
mat_nodes = [MaterialScan, ChemicalTest, ImagingCapture]
mat_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=mat_nodes)
mat_po.order.add_edge(MaterialScan, ChemicalTest)
mat_po.order.add_edge(MaterialScan, ImagingCapture)
# ChemicalTest and ImagingCapture are concurrent (no edge between them)

# Authentication: ExpertReview --> ConsensusVote (vote after review)
# LegalVerify can happen after ExpertReview and ConsensusVote

# The overall validation before certification:
# After Artifact Intake, provenance_po, mat_po and auth_po need to be done.
# ProvenanceCheck sequence and material analysis might start concurrently after Artifact Intake.
# Then Authentication after provenance+material testing

# So after ArtifactIntake:
# concurrently Provenance and Material analysis:
prov_mat_po = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[provenance_po, mat_po])
# no edges between provenance_po and mat_po to indicate concurrency

# Then authentication after both provenance and material:
# So ordering: ArtifactIntake --> provenance_po and mat_po (concurrent), then --> auth_po

# Because provenance_po and mat_po are StrictPartialOrder objects, they are nodes in the dependency order

# We can model the concurrency of provenance_po and mat_po by having them as nodes in a PO with no order edge between them
# Then auth_po depends on both.

# Stakeholder coordination includes EthicsReview, MarketAnalysis, LegalVerify (already in auth_po), Auction houses part not explicit, 
# LegalVerify is in auth_po, so EthicsReview and MarketAnalysis concurrent with LegalVerify?
# Letâ€™s model EthicsReview and MarketAnalysis as concurrent activities after or during authentication.

# After stakeholder review, final Certification including Blockchain log:
# Certification step: BlockchainLog after EthicsReview & MarketAnalysis
